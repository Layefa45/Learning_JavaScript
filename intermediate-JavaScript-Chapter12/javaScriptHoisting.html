        <h1>JAVASCRIPT HOISTING</h1>
        <p>
            Hoisting is the principle of moving declarations of variables to the top of the scope in which they are defined. <br>
            This allows you to do things that you cannot do in many other languages.
        </p>

        <code>
            <pre>
    var x;
    x = 5;
    console.log(x); // OUTPUT: 5
            </pre>
        </code>
        <p>
            But thanks to hoisting, so does this;
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
    x = 5;
    console.log(x); //OUTPUT: 5
    var x;
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            If you try to do this with 'let', you will get a 'ReferenceError'. This is why it is better to use 'let'. Because this behaviour is very hard to read. <br>
            And sometimes very unpredictable, and you really don't need it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The reason why this happens is that the JavaScript interpreter moves all the 'var' declarations to the top of the file before processing the file. <br>
            This is why you get a result of 'undefined' if you use it before it has been declared. <br>
            It was designed this way for memory allocation, but the side effects are undesirable. <br>
            However there is a way to turn off this behaviour, using <b>strict mode.</b>
        </p>

        <script>
            var x;
            x = 5;
            console.log(x);

            x1 = 5;
            console.log(x1); //OUTPUT: 5
            var x1;
        </script>
    </body>
