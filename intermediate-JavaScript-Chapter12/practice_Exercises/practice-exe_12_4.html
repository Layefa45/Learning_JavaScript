        <p>
            Variables values can be tracked in the editor while <b>debugging.</b> <br>
            The following exercise will demonstrate how to use the breakpoints to check a value of a variable at a certain point in the running of the script.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a simple example, but the same process can be used to find information about larger scripts at specific points during execution, or establish where a problem lie. 
        </p>
        
        <script>
            let val = 5;
            val += adder();
            val += adder();
            val += adder();
            console.log(val);

            function adder() {
                let counter = val;
                for (let i = 0; i < val; i++ ) {
                    counter++;
                }
                return counter;
            }
